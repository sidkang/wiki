## 1.1 Four ways to Represent a Function

$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$

The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$.

!!! note ""

    A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ exactly one element, called $f(x)$, in a set $E$.
