An economic variable is said to be **procyclical**(顺周期) if its deviations from trend are positively correlated with the deviations from trend in real GDP, **countercyclical**(逆周期) if its deviations from trend are negatively correlated with the deviations from trend in real GDP, and **acyclical**(非周期性) if it is neither procyclical nor countercyclical

loading variable(先行变量), lagging variable(滞后变量), coincideng variable(一致变量)

A measure of cyclical variability is the standard deviation of the percentage deviations from trend.
