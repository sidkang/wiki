# Overview

# What and how to learn
Simply put, learning piano comprises of two things:
1) THE WHAT: Identifying the current skills you need to focus on to drive up your playing ability.
2) THE HOW: Once you've identified what to learn, building a proper practice routine to keep yourself moving forward and interested.

# Beginner State

1) Sight Reading
2) Music Theory
   1) What notes are what on the keyboard.
   2) What notes are what on the grand staff (sheet music!)
   3) How to read note rhythms and rests.
   4) Key signatures.
   5) Time signatures.

Music Theory Goal:
is to get to the point where you can: - Look at a keyboard and name any note on it. - Look at treble clef and name any note on it. - Look at bass clef and name any note on it. - Be able to to look at sheet music and clap through a rhythm. - Be able to read a key signature and understand how that affects the notes on the page. - Be able to read the time signature and understand how to count the beats in a measure.


I am having trouble learning to read sheet music.

# How to Practice

The key to effective practice is to build a proper practice routine. It's better to practice a bit every day instead of binging all on one day. It takes time for your brain to develop new skills like reading music, hand coordination, and muscle memory.

A good practice routine will include time for:

1) Warm up exercises to get your fingers moving and building finger strength and dexterity.
2) Songs you are learning to build up your repertoire and keep your skills growing.
3) Repertoire review, to ensure pieces you already know don't go stale.
4) Open time to "rock out" and have fun so you can have time each practice session to just play and have fun without worrying about advancing specific skills.

While practicing, consider the following tips for troublesome pieces or sections:
1) Practice with a metronome, drum beat, or along with a pre-recorded track. Always start very slowly, and only when you can play something 3-4x without mistakes at a tempo, increase it.
2) Take notes while practicing. If there's a particular section giving you trouble, or you need to remember certain fingering patterns, or note the current tempo you're working on, take those notes each time you practice and review them before starting that exercise or song the next day.

# Practice Tips

Here at /r/pianolearning, we recommend using tuneUPGRADE, a free online practice journal that'll help you get the most out of your practice. If you prefer to keep an offline practice journal or use a spreadsheet, that will work just fine as well.

1) Set a weekly practice goal and work towards it. Stick to a simple goal of how much you'll practice each week. If you miss it one week, no big deal, it's a marathon, not a sprint! Try again next week. Don't cut corners. 30 minutes of practice is 30 minutes of practice, not 24!
2) Adjust your routine regularly to avoid it getting stale. Your routine should have:
   1) Exercises for warming up and focusing on specific techniques you're having trouble mastering
   2) Songs you're working on. Once you learn a song, you'll add it to your repertoire.
   3) Repertoire review. Keep the songs you've already learned fresh, so you can perform pretty well on demand!
   4) Rock out time! Have fun each practice session - play what you want, even if it might be something easy that you have fun with to keep your interest.
3) While your breakdown of time allocated to each of these things will vary as your routine evolves, for absolute beginners targeting a 30-60 minute practice routine, strive for 5-10 minutes of exercises, 15-30 minutes of learning new songs (2-3 songs at a time), 5-10 minutes of repertoire review, and then any remaining time to just rock out and experiment!
4) Most importantly, each time you practice something, take practice notes on what you just played. Were there particularly challenging sections? Do you need to write down the tempo (how fast you were able to play through it)? Reflect on your practice. What did you do well, what did you do poorly and should try slowing down for next time?
5) It's way better to play slowly and correctly than making a mistake going through quickly. Fast play will come with time. Use your metronome to keep pace, and if you are making a mistake, SLOW DOWN. Try to practice something 4 times perfectly at a slow tempo before you speed it up.
6) Practice every day, even if you can't get through your whole routine! If you're feeling unmotivated, just start with trying to get 5 minutes in, and see if you want to keep going. You'll get much better results practicing a bit each day than binging once a week.

**This advice does not change whether you are a beginner or an expert.** Following proper practice habits, reflecting on your practice, tracking your practice time, practicing daily - these are habits that will never lose usefulness.
